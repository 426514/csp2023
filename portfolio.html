        <p>
           The operating system (Zorin) I was able to run on a computer was very easy to navigate through. Which was the
          main reason why I chose it because I didn't know much about how to run a virtual machine on a computer. A
          virtual machine is a software that is able to run programs,operating systems, and other things.

        This palet that I have created is inspired of the work of Ellesworth Kelly and his Spectrum V artwork. I was
        able to make this piece of work by putting 5 divs in my html, and putting color into background. Then, I fixed
        it's height, width, and location to make my final product.
